line 1: srtaightforward.

There are a couple things to notice.

The first is that each line has a set number of repetitions of '.|.', which are centered, and the rest is filled by '-'.

The second is that the flag is symmetrical, so if you have the top, you have the bottom by reversing it. You only need to work on n // 2 (n is odd and you need the integer div because the remaining line is the "WELCOME" line).

line 2: I generate 2\*i + 1 '.|.', center it, and fill the rest with '-'. That's basically the top part of the output.

line 3: put things together. '\n'.join() should be straightforward. Then, the sequence of strings to join is the pattern described above, the middle 'WELCOME' line, and the pattern reversed.
